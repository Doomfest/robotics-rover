The mini rover's motors have the following raw range from the microcontroller manager:

Motor 1:
Reverse:    1
Stop:       64
Forward:    127

Motor 2:
Reverse:    128
Stop:       192
Forward:    255

The mini rover server should take the following commands:

Reverse:
    Takes an integer between 1 and 63 from slowest to fastest. Activates every motor.
    
Stop:
    Takes no argument. Stops every motor.
    
Forward:
    Takes an integer between 1 and 63 from slowest to fastest. Activates every motor.
