The mini rover's motors have the following raw range from the microcontroller manager:

Motor 1 (right side)
Forward:    [1-63] decreasing speed
Stop:       [64]
Reverse:    [65-127] increasing speed

Motor 2 (left side)
Reverse:    [128-191] decreasing speed
Stop:       [192]
Forward:    [193-255] increasing speed

Note: we are not using the 128 max reverse speed

The mini rover server should take the following commands:

Reverse:
    Takes an integer between 1 and 63 from slowest to fastest. Activates every motor.
    
Stop:
    Takes no argument. Stops every motor.
    
Forward:
    Takes an integer between 1 and 63 from slowest to fastest. Activates every motor.
